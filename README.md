# Database Systems on Modern CPU Architectures
This repository contains the assignments completed for the course "[Database Systems on Modern CPU Architectures](https://db.in.tum.de/teaching/ss23/moderndbs/?lang=en)" taught by Prof. Thomas Neumann at the Technical University of Munich during the summer semester of 2023. Each assignment is stored on a separate branch within the repository. As the deadlines for each assignment pass, I will be updating this repository with the latest code and materials related to the respective assignment.
## Disclaimer
The code might not be as concise as possible (for example, it includes commented-out sections). This is because it reflects the state of the code when it was initially submitted. Therefore, the cleanliness and organization of the code are influenced by the time constraints I had when writing it.
